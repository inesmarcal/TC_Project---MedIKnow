# TC_Project-MedIKnow
- [x] Finished

## Description
This project was developed for the Computer Technology subject @University of Coimbra, Informatics Engineering.  
The goal of this project was to conceptualize a solution for an existing problem with the help of an Arduino Plataform. We came up with the idea of a clock - **MedIKnow** - whose main purpose was to remind people of the medication they needed to take, as well as the exact time they had to do so.
